What is a Synchronous System?
In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another.

Think of this as if you have just one hand to accomplish 10 tasks. So, you have to complete one task at a time.


In this system, tasks are completed independently.
Here, imagine that for 10 tasks, you have 10 hands. So, each hand can do each task independently and at the same time.


Callback:
    calling a function inside another function is called callback
    for eg:
        function one () {
            console.log("step 1")
        }

        function two (){
            console.log("Step 2)
        }

    As u can see we have two functions , which will run top to down
    in order to form a relation btw these 2 function, we use callback with arguement

    for eg:

    function one(call_two) {
        console.log("step 1 completed , pplease call step 2")

        call_two()
    }

    one(two)
